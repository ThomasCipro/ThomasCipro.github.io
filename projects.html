    <p>As a MA candidate within the history department at SUNY Binghamton, I am completing a portfoilio that contains several different works within it. Given that I am only at the beginning of my time in the MA program, I do not have much work to link here, bar two term papers. I will be coming back to update this website with my work as I continue my studies.</p>
